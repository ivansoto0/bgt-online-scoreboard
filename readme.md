BGT scoreboard!
Written by Ivan Soto

Introduction:
So...looking all over the place, I attempted to make the scoreboard from blastbay.com to work on my website, and it didn't work. At the time, I was writing a small game in BGT that had scores and I wanted a scoreboard. My PHP skills arn't the best and certainly not to write my own scoreboard. I could in BGT though.
I thought hey, I think I know how to write a scoreboard in bgt. So I did.
You are free to use this scoreboard, but please know that I, Ivan Soto from http://ims-productions.com wrote this and you may not say you wrote this. Please give credit if possible.

**Using
I tried to document the score server itself because that's what does most of the work. The client is just there, and that is where you are going to have to do your part of the work. I did not make this so someone can open a BGT script and oh ok, lets just write 5 lines of code and get a scoreboard up and running. If you know what you're doing, well good, you can post scores, list scores, I made that easy btw no problem.

**Contacting
If you have anything to ask, just contact me. You can send me a messsage on skype, email, or send me a DM.
